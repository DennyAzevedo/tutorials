    "The [ImageJ software stack](http://imagej.net/Architecture#Core_libraries) is composed of the following core libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [SciJava Common](http://imagej.net/SciJava_Common) - The SciJava application container and plugin framework.\n",
    "* [ImgLib2](http://imagej.net/ImgLib2) - The N-dimensional image data model.\n",
    "* [ImageJ Common](http://imagej.net/ImageJ_Common) - Metadata-rich image data structures and SciJava extensions.\n",
    "* [ImageJ Ops](http://imagej.net/ImageJ_Ops) - The framework for reusable image processing operations.\n",
    "* [SCIFIO](http://imagej.net/SCIFIO) - The framework for N-dimensional image I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries form the basis of ImageJ-based software.\n",

    "Important design goals of ImageJ include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Modularity.__ ImageJ libraries provide a good [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). Developers in need of specific functionality may depend on only those components which are relevant, rather than needing to add a dependency to the entire ImageJ software stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __UI agnosticm.__ The core libraries take great pains to be _UI agnostic_ with no dependencies on packages such as `java.awt` or `javax.swing`. It should be possible to build a [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) (UI) on top of the core libraries without needing to change the library code itself. There are several proof-of-concept UIs for ImageJ using different UI frameworks, including [Swing](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ui-swing), [AWT](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ui-awt), [Apache Pivot](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-ui-pivot) and [JavaFX](https://github.com/cmongis/imagejfx).\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Extensibility.__ ImageJ provides many different types of plugins, and it is possible to extend the system with your own new types of plugins. See the \"Extending ImageJ\" tutorials for details.\n",
    "\n",
